## Hello! üëã

My name is Juan Manuel, and I currently work as an **Embedded Software Developer & Sysadmin** at **Ulbios**.  
I have a strong background in **STEM fields** including **Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Statistics, Programming, and Electronics**. I have also worked as an instructor in these subjects at different academies in Madrid. Currently, I live in Barcelona.

I recently obtained the **Azure Database Administrator Associate (DP-300)** certification.  

This repository is a collection of my projects, skills, and experience in programming, data analysis, engineering, and data science.
